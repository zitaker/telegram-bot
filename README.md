Will work through the website (https://www.pythonanywhere.com) or you need to install libraries on your computer.  

List of available commands:    
```/ show``` - print all tasks on a given date  
```/ add``` - add a task  
```/ random``` - add a random task for today  
```/ help``` - print out the help
